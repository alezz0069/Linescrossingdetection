# Correcci√≥n Intersecciones

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates image processing techniques to detect and analyze line segments in an image.

## Overview

The notebook (`Correccion_intersecciones.ipynb`) performs the following tasks:

1. Load and preprocess an image.
2. Apply Canny edge detection for identifying edges.
3. Use Hough Line Transformation to detect line segments.
4. Analyze and filter the detected segments based on their orientation and length.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and open the `Correccion_intersecciones.ipynb` notebook.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells.
